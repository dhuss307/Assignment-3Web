                Hello, welcome to my portfolio, my name is Daniyal Hussain, I am in my first year of Mount Royal University in the program of Computer Information Systems. <br>
                Throughout my first year, I have developed skills in programming languages like Java, Html, and CSS. Towards the future, I hope to improve on these skills <br>
                of mine and use them to achieve my goals. I hope you enjoy knowing a little about myself and showing off the various acheivements and the things I have <br>
                involved with. Thank you for visiting my portfolio.

            <h4>Snake Game</h4>
            <p class="des">
                One of my projects I have made is a Snake game with Java. Throughout the game I faced challenges such as figuring out how to make it that the apple goes to random spots of 
                the page. With this game, I used java libraries like javax and used a gui system imbeded with the IDE I used to develop the game. In the image below is a demonstration
                of the game's design. With making this game, I was able to increase my knowledge in programming and now I am able to use this knowledge to create more programming projects.

            <h4>ICSC Internship</h4>
            <p class="des">
                I also have been able to work for a non-profit organization called Islamic Center of South Calgary as an intern. For this company, I work as an IT assistant to help the 
                organization with tasks such as website maintenance, online school technical support, and program organization. With each task given, I was put through challenges that would
                help me with problem solving for example, I was asked to design and develop a form for volenteer recruitment. For the last 6 months, I was able to put my skills of 
                programming to help this company grow.

        <h4>Inventory System</h4>
        <p class="des">
            Another one of my projects I have been working on is a Inventory system with Java. This allows the user to either search a toy and purchase it, add a toy into the database, and 
            remove a toy from the database. The libraries I used for this program are JavaFX and the utilities that are imbedded within this plugin. To design the program I used an app
            called Scenebuilder. This made it easier to design as it would require me to learn a completely different language. This program required me to face challenges and overcome 
            these challenges.

            <h4>Tutoring</h4>
            <p class="des">
                At this non-profit company, Skookum Jim Friendship Centre, I was asked to tutor the various students that have signed up for their learning programs. With this task in hand,
                I was put through challenges as different students had different subjects and I needed to teach myself some of these courses. Although, this job allowed me to use my leadership
                skills and improve on them. Skookum Jim Friendship Centre goal was to ensure the physical and mental well-being of First Nations, and fostering the way of Friendship & understanding 
                between people.
